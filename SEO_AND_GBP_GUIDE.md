## 🗺️ Part 1: Google Business Profile (The "Map" Pack)
*This is the most important part for a local clinic.*

### Step 1: Claim & Verify
1.  Go to **[google.com/business](https://google.com/business)**.
2.  Search for "OralCare" (or the client's actual name).
    *   If it exists: Click "Claim this business."
    *   If not: Click "Add your business to Google."
3.  **Category:** Choose `Dental Clinic` (Primary) and `Cosmetic Dentist` (Secondary).
4.  **Verification:** You will likely need to endure a video call verification or receive a postcard at the doctor's address. *Warn the client about this step.*

### Step 2: The "Perfect Profile" Checklist
*   **Name:** Use the EXACT name on their board. No keyword stuffing (e.g., Don't use "Best Dentist Chennai").
*   **Hours:** Must be accurate.
*   **Phone:** Use the local number.
*   **Website:** Link to your new React site.
*   **Photos:** Upload AT LEAST 20 photos.
    *   3 Exterior (Building view).
    *   3 Interior (Reception, Chair).
    *   5 Team (Doctor & Staff).
    *   **Pro Tip:** Rename the image files *before* uploading to `dentist-chennai-perungudi-interior.jpg`. Google reads filenames!

### Step 3: The "Products" Section
*   Did you know you can add "Products" to a GMB?
*   Add "Veneers," "Implant," "Root Canal" as products with a price range (e.g., "₹3,000 - ₹5,000").
*   Link these products directly to your "Services" section on the website.

## 🔍 Part 2: On-Page SEO (The Website Code)
*Since this is a React SPA (Single Page App), we need to be careful.*

### Step 1: Update Title Tags & Meta Descriptions
Go to [index.html](file:///c:/Users/LENOVO/Downloads/dental%20clinic/index.html) and update the `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`.
*   **Bad Title:** `Home | OralCare`
*   **Good Title:** `Best Cosmetic Dentist in Perungudi, Chennai | OralCare Clinic`
*   **Meta Description:** `Dr. Sivaranjani specializes in Pain-Free Veneers, Implants, and Smile Makeovers in Chennai. 15+ Years Exp. Book a Consultation: +91 99977 97777.`

### Step 2: Image Alt Text
*   Go through [constants.tsx](file:///c:/Users/LENOVO/Downloads/dental%20clinic/constants.tsx).
*   Every time there is an image, ensure there is descriptive text.
*   *Code Example:* `<img src="..." alt="Patient receiving dental implant in Velachery clinic" />`
*   **Why?** Google Image Search brings local traffic.

### Step 3: Create a Sitemap
*   Use a free generator like [xml-sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/).
*   Enter the live URL (e.g., `oralcare-chennai.com`).
*   Download `sitemap.xml`.
*   Put it in your `public/` folder.

## 💡 Quick Tips for the "Upsell"
*   **Don't say:** "I will do SEO." (Too vague).
*   **Say:** "I will set up your digital footprint so you appear on Google Maps when people search 'Dentist near me'."
*   **The Secret Weapon:** **Citations**. Go to JustDial, Sulekha, and Practo. Create free profiles for them. Ensure the Name, Address, and Phone (NAP) are *identical* to Google Maps. Google trusts businesses that exist everywhere.
